# Plane Maze

## Introduction

This game is part of IronHack's first test. Make a simple 2D game. I did it with JS in almost every part, some snippets
where done with HTML and CSS.

### How to play & Objectives
In this game you will play as an airplane pilot trying to survive ominous waves of enemy airplanes.
The problem is, its war time! Our supply lines where cut short, you are low on fuel and no ammunition for your guns.
But there is some hope, our allies sent some bombers with spare fuel. 

* You have to get close to the bombers to refuel.
* Use the direcionals from your keyboard to control the plane.

Try to stay alive and have fun!
